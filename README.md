## Primary Smart Contract and UI Components

### NEXUS TOKEN
The NEXU token has a 1.1 Billion max supply. It is Minted by the NexusGenerator starting at 5 NEXU per block and slowly decreasing in distribution rate over time (similar to the Bitcoin Halving mechanism). 90% of these newly minted NEXU rewards go to liquidity providers and 10% of the NEXU minted goes to the Nexus Core Multi-Staking. NEXU Token can be staked by itself or paired with an NFT in the Nexus Core Multi-Staking. Users can time-lock their NEXU and NFTs to gain multipliers in their share of the pool. The NEXU Token will be used to Govern The Nexus.

### NEXUS GENERATOR(Yield Farming Contract)
This is where users can stake their liquidity tokens ($NLPs) to earn $NEXU and potentially more Superfarm Rewards.

### NEXUS FACTORY
Swapping Contract/Liquidity Token Manager. Fees generated by the Factory contract are sent to the NexusDiffuser to be distributed back to users.

### NEXUS LIQUIDITY TOKENS $NLP
Liquidity Tokens represent different tokens pairs created by the community.

### NEXUS DIFFUSER
The Nexus Diffuser receives $NLPs of different kinds from the Nexus Factory setFeeToo. The Diffuser buys and burns $NEXU with some of those $NLPs (primarily WXRP/NEXU). The rest of the $NLPs are and sent to the Nexus Core Multi-Staking to be distributed proportionally to $NEXU/$ETHER Stakers.

### NEXUS ETHEREALS NFTS
There are 11,111 AI Generated Nexus Ethereal NFTs! Each NFT holds a share of the Nexus Core Multi-Staking pool. NFTs can be staked in the Nexus Core Multi-Staking system to earn NEXU token and NLPs.

### NEXUS NFT WEIGHTS
The Nexus NFT weights are stored in this smart contract. The Nexus Core Multi-Staking gets the weight values from here so it knows how to distribute the rewards to the users.

### NEXUS CORE MULTISTAKING
The Nexus Core is where users can stake and time-lock their $NEXU Tokens and Nexus NFTs to earn $NEXU, $NLPs and potentially other Tokens from many different sources. Some sources may including fees from Superfarm deposits and

### NEXUS CORE MULTISTAKING DISTRIBUTOR
The Nexus Core Multi-Staking Distributor acts as a proxy contract for the different ERC-20 and Native token distributions. This is a security measure to make sure no one can take advantage of the Multi-Staking Contract rewards distribution. The "Distribute" button is publicly called by users to distribute rewards.

#### 1. **Install Dependencies**
   To install all the necessary dependencies for your project, run the following command in your project's root directory:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

#### 2. **Start Development Server**
   To start the development server, use the following command:
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
   Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.

#### 3. **Build the Project**
   To build your project for production, execute the following command:
   ```sh
   yarn build
   ```
   This command will create an optimized build of your application.

### ðŸš€ **Vercel Deployment**

#### 1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   To install Vercel CLI globally on your system, run the following command:
   ```sh
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

#### 2. **Login to Vercel**
   To log in to your Vercel account, execute the following command and follow the prompts:
   ```sh
   vercel login
   ```

#### 3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   To deploy your application to Vercel, run the following command from your project directory and follow the prompts:
   ```sh
   vercel
   ```
   Once the deployment is successful, Vercel CLI will provide you with a live URL where your application is hosted.

### ðŸ“˜ **Notes**
- Ensure that you have Node.js and Yarn installed on your system before running Yarn commands.
- If your development server runs on a different port, replace `http://localhost:3000` with the appropriate port.
- For Vercel deployment, ensure that you have a Vercel account. If you donâ€™t have one, you can sign up [here](https://vercel.com/signup).
